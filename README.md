# ðŸ¥³ HelloWorld!

:wave:Hi, this is Harry. Welcome to my bumpy road to learn Linux.&#x20;

:robot:In this era of ChatGPT, people may probably lose interest and patience to read tedious official docs or three-party tutorials. So I write this note to help you to learn how to operate Linux system only in one stop.

:books:Specifically speaking, I will only give you a complete and detailed notebook, containing scipts of how to achieve a certain target and references if necessarily, instead of teaching how to use some certain instructions or debug some certain errors. If a brief enough tutorial has existed in Internet, I'll also only attach some recommended references.

:heart:I would feel grateful if you can join me !
